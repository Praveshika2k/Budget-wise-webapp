BudgetWise - Smart Budget Allocation
Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend (if any): None (Client-side only)

Storage: LocalStorage (for saving budget data)

Charting: JavaScript (possibly Chart.js for visualizing budget allocations)

Functionality:
BudgetWise is a simple web application that helps users allocate and manage their budgets efficiently. Users can set a budget, allocate funds to different categories, and track expenses dynamically.

Dining Philosopherâ€™s Algorithm for Budget Allocation:
The project applies the Dining Philosopherâ€™s Algorithm to ensure fair and deadlock-free budget allocation. Each budget category is treated as a "philosopher" requesting a portion of the budget (a shared resource). By managing requests carefully, the system prevents one category from consuming all resources, ensuring balanced distribution and avoiding deadlocks.

ðŸ“Œ Usage:

Enter the landing page and proceed to the budget setup.

Define your total budget and allocate amounts to different spending categories.

Track your allocations and remaining budget dynamically.

ðŸš€ Future Enhancements: Integration with external APIs, user authentication, and cloud storage for persistent data.
